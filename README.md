This is a collection of extensions for the videogame library manager [Playnite](https://playnite.link) (repository: https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite).

# Installation
There are several ways to install these extensions. First, make sure you have Playnite installed (see links above). Then, pick from any of these options:
- In Playnite itself: `main menu > Add-ons > Browse`
- From [the Playnite website's Add-ons page](https://playnite.link/addons.html)
- Download the extensions from [the release section of this repository](https://github.com/Jeshibu/PlayniteExtensions/releases)

After installing, you will be prompted to restart. Click yes. Then, have a look at the extension's settings (if any) in `main menu > Add-ons > Extension settings`. Many, like the Giant Bomb, MobyGames, and LaunchBox extensions, require extra user action to function properly, for example by entering an API key.

# Contributing
Pull requests are appreciated, but unless they're small fixes, it's best to discuss the changes first (for example in an issue). Nobody wants to have a significant amount of work rejected.
