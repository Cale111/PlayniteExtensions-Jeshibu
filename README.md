# Playnite Extensions
A set of extensions made for [Playnite](https://playnite.link).

## Donations
These extensions will always be free, but if you want to pass me some money, here's how: 

## Libraries
### GamersGate | [Install](playnite://playnite/installaddon/GamersGateLibrary)

This imports all the games that can be downloaded from GamersGate (DRM free as well as stuff like SecuROM).
As a workaround for GamersGate's very restrictive CloudFlare scraping/DDOS/botting protection, the import process uses a visible browser window.


### Groupees
[Install](playnite://playnite/installaddon/GroupeesLibrary_42ff71aa-34dc-4b12-86b6-1328136c958f)

Imports downloadable games from Groupees. Requires authentication, and has manual authentication.
